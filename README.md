# Project 4: Predicting Credit Card Customer Attrition
## Group 1: Alex Delacruz, Bennett Northcutt, Emily Neaville, Hays Kronke, and Stephen Mims
## Dataset: https://zenodo.org/record/4322342#.Y8OsBdJBwUE

### Summary:
Our group will use this dataset to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer attrition. This dataset contains customer information ranging from demographic (age, gender, education) to financial data (income bracket, card history, credit limit). We aim to designate key points that will determine what areas are key to this customer retention.

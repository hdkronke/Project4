### Predicting Customer Attrition - Credit Cards

### Dataset: https://zenodo.org/record/4322342#.Y8OsBdJBwUE

A business manager of a consumer credit card portfolio is facing the problem of customer attrition. They want to analyze the data to find out the reason behind this and leverage the same to predict customers who are likely to drop off.

We could construct a model to predict which customer might be churned and the manager could proactively provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.
